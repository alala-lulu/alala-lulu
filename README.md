# Welcome!

## About Me

Hello, world! My name is Luise, and I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development. I'm beginning my journey and I am absolutely loving the process of studying and learning new technologies!

## Interests

I am interested in **Data Science**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Game Development**. I'm still early to the field, so I’m exploring different paths and learning as much as I can along the way.


## Current Learning

- **Introduction to Cybersecurity**: I have completed an introductory course offered by Cisco, which has provided me with a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles. [View Course](https://www.netacad.com/pt/courses/cybersecurity-essentials?courseLang=en-US)
- **Linux Course**: I am currently in a Linux course to enhance my understanding of operating systems and command-line tools, which are essential for cybersecurity and data management. [View Course](https://www.netacad.com/pt/courses/linux-essentials?courseLang=en-US)
